# Mobile Optimization Progress Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**
Convert Monkey Unicycle game to work properly on mobile devices with tilt controls and responsive design.

## âœ… **Completed Tasks**

### **1. Fixed Banana Image Path**
- **Issue**: Code looking for `banana-clipart_sm.png` but file was `banana_clipart_sm.png`
- **Fixed**: Updated image path in game.js line ~31

### **2. Added Tilt Controls**
- **Feature**: Automatic tilt detection for mobile devices
- **Orientation Support**: Works in portrait and landscape modes
- **Auto-calibration**: Calibrates on game start and orientation change
- **Manual Recalibration**: Double-tap during gameplay
- **Toggle**: "TILT: ON/OFF" button in main menu

### **3. Responsive Design**
- **Full Screen**: Game fills entire mobile viewport
- **Auto-scaling**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Orientation Handling**: Automatically adjusts when rotating device
- **Touch Optimized**: Large buttons and touch-friendly interface

### **4. Touch Control Fixes**
- **Coordinate Conversion**: Fixed touch coordinate mapping
- **Unified Input**: Mouse and touch use same coordinate system
- **Visual Feedback**: Red circles show touch locations (debug mode)
- **Button Responsiveness**: Menu buttons now work with touch

## ðŸ”§ **Current Status**
- **Tilt Controls**: âœ… Working in all orientations
- **Image Loading**: âœ… Fixed banana image path
- **Touch Menu**: âœ… Buttons responding to touch (improved)
- **Responsive Layout**: âœ… Scales to mobile screens
- **Visual Feedback**: âœ… Debug circles show touch points

### **5. Dynamic Physics Settings** âœ…
- **Device-Aware**: Different base settings for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Screen-Scaled**: Physics adjust based on screen size and aspect ratio
- **Smart Scaling**: Gravity, balance, jump power, and speed all scale appropriately
- **User Override**: Custom settings are preserved and not overwritten
- **Auto-Update**: Settings recalculate on orientation change or window resize

### **6. Improved Tilt Sensitivity & Jump Button** âœ…
- **Increased Tilt Sensitivity**: Reduced deadzone from 5Â° to 2Â°, increased responsiveness
- **Better Tilt Response**: More immediate velocity changes, higher max tilt boost
- **Fixed Jump Button**: Now always centered at bottom, larger size (100px on mobile)
- **Visual Jump Button**: Round orange button, more prominent than other controls
- **Enhanced Debug**: Touch feedback shows which button was pressed

### **7. Fixed Jump Button Visual & Improved Gameplay** âœ…
- **Fixed Jump Button Rendering**: Corrected canvas transform issues for mobile
- **Increased Gravity**: Mobile: 0.25, Tablet: 0.28, Desktop: 0.30 (was too low)
- **Zoomed Out Camera**: More gameplay area visible, monkey positioned better
- **Larger Game Area**: Base dimensions increased from 800x400 to 1200x600

### **8. Mobile Menu Optimization** âœ…
- **Responsive Scaling**: All menu elements scale based on screen size
- **Fixed Button Overlapping**: Proper spacing prevents button overlap
- **Sound Effects**: Button clicks and hovers now make sounds
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger buttons on mobile, better positioning
- **Dynamic Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

### **9. Speedy Monkey Improvements** âœ…
- **Increased Max Speed**: Mobile: 5.5, Tablet: 6.0, Desktop: 6.5 (was 3.5-4.5)
- **Faster Acceleration**: 0.7 per frame (was 0.4) - much more responsive
- **Reduced Friction**: 0.94 (was 0.92) - maintains speed better
- **Enhanced Tilt Response**: 0.12 responsiveness, 0.9 max boost (was 0.08/0.6)
- **Improved Balance Effect**: 0.12 (was 0.08) - more dynamic movement
- **Higher Jump Power**: Increased across all devices for more excitement

## ðŸš§ **Still Working On**
- Testing the new zippy movement feel across devices
- Balancing speed vs. control for different skill levels
- Fine-tuning tilt sensitivity for the faster speeds

## ðŸ“± **Key Files Modified**
- `game.js` - Main game logic with mobile optimizations
- `index.html` - Mobile viewport and meta tags
- `README.md` - Updated with mobile instructions
- `mobile-test.html` - Device compatibility testing page

## ðŸŽ® **How to Test**
1. Open game on mobile device
2. Allow motion permissions when prompted
3. Look for red circles when tapping (shows touch detection)
4. Try tilt controls in different orientations
5. Test menu button responsiveness

## ðŸ’¡ **Next Steps**
- Continue refining touch responsiveness
- Test on various mobile devices
- Optimize performance for older devices
- Consider adding haptic feedback
